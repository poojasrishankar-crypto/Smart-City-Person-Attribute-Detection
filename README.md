# Smart City Person Attribute Detection

Multi-label person attribute recognition system for smart city surveillance using ResNet50 and PyTorch.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project detects multiple attributes of a person from an image such as:

- Upper & Lower body clothing color
- Clothing type (Jacket, Kurta, Saree, Shirt, etc.)
- Sleeves length
- Carry items (Handbag, Backpack)
- Accessories (Headgear)
- Footwear (Shoes, Sandals, Slippers)
- Pose (Standing, Sitting, Lying)
- View orientation (Front / Back)

The system is built using **Transfer Learning with ResNet50** and trained using **BCEWithLogitsLoss** for multi-label classification.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric        | Value (Approx) |
|--------------|----------------|
| Training Loss | ~0.35 |
| Validation Loss | ~0.32 |
| Accuracy | ~0.84 |
| F1 Score | ~0.81 |
| Epochs | 5 |

## 🔍 Sample Inference Output

Example prediction on test image:

Detected Attributes:
- Foot_slippers (0.69)
- POSE_standing (0.95)
- VIEW_front (0.52)

Confidence values represent probability scores from the sigmoid output layer.
